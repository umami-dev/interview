# Tripla Engineering: Take-Home Assignments

Welcome\! This repository contains the take-home assignments we use for our technical hiring process at Tripla. Each exercise is designed to give you a feel for the kind of challenges we work on every day.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which assignment should I work on?

Please do not work on all of them. Your hiring manager will send you a direct link to the specific assignment you should complete.

If you are unsure which one to work on, please contact our talent acquisition team before you begin.

### How do I submit my solution?

Please follow these steps to submit your work:

1.  **Create a new, public repository** on your personal GitHub or GitLab account.
2.  **Copy the assignment code** into your new repository. You can do this by cloning our repository and pushing it to your new one, or by downloading the code as a ZIP and committing it.
3.  **Email the link** to your personal repository to the person who sent you the assignment.

**Important:** Please **do not fork our repository or open a pull request**. We use pull requests to manage and update the assignments, not to review candidate submissions.

### Can I use an AI assistant or LLM to help with the assignment?

Up to you. Our goal is to see how you solve problems in a real-world setting. If LLMs are part of your standard workflow, you are welcome to use them.

However, If you use an AI assistant, please document its usage in your `README.md`, including:
1.  Which parts of the solution were developed with AI assistance.
2.  A description of the tools and your workflow.

We are interested in how you leverage modern tools to build great software.

### What happens after I submit?

Once you submit, our engineering team will review your solution. We will always provide you with feedback on your submission. If your solution aligns well with the role, we will contact you to schedule a follow-up interview to walk through your code with you.

### I have an idea for a feature. Should I build it?

That's up to you. We intentionally leave the problems open-ended to see how you make product and engineering decisions.

However, the priority should always be a simple, robust, and well-tested solution to the core problem. If a new feature feels like it would take several hours or days to implement, it's likely out of scope and not essential.

### Is it okay to share my solution publicly?

Yes, absolutely. You put in the time, so you own the code. It's completely reasonable for you to keep your solution and use it as you see fit. The real value for us is in the process and the conversation around your submission.

### The requirements seem ambiguous. What should I do?

That's often intentional\! We want to see how you handle ambiguity and make design choices when the path isn't perfectly clear.

Our preference is that you make a reasonable assumption, document it in your `README`, and move forward. There's no wrong answer in these situations. If you feel completely blocked, don't hesitate to email us, and we'll be happy to provide clarification.

### Why a take-home assignment?

This assignment is a practical way for us to see your problem-solving skills on a realistic challenge. It's also a chance for you to see the kind of work we do and decide if it's a good fit. We use your submission as the starting point for a technical conversation in our follow-up interview.
